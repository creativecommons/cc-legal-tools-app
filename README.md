# cc-legal-tools-app

**Creative Commons (CC) Legal Tools Application.** This repository contains the
application that manages the license tools and public domain tools (static
HTML, internationalization and localization files, etc.). It consumes and
generates data in the [creativecommons/cc-legal-tools-data][repodata]
repository.

## About

This application manages 639 legal tools (636 licenses and 3 public domain
tools). The current version of the licenses is 4.0 and includes 6 licenses.
They are international and are designed to operate globally, ensuring they are
robust, enforceable and easily adopted worldwide. Prior versions were adapted
to specific jurisdictions ("ported"). That is why there are 636 licenses.

Broadly speaking, each legal tool consists of three layers:
1. `deed`: a plain language summary of the legal tool
2. `legalcode`: the legal tool itself
3. `rdf`: metadata about the legal tool in RDF/XML format

With translations of the deed and translations of the legal code, this
application manages over 30,000 documents.


### Not the live site

This project is not intended to serve the legal tools directly. Instead, a
command line tool can be used to save all the rendered HTML and RDF/XML pages
as files. Then those files are used as part of the CreativeCommons.org
site (served as static files).


## Setup and Usage

Once this project's required dependencies (Docker, Git, etc.) are enabled on
your system, you will be able to run the legal-tools application and generate
static files.

For information on learning and installing the prerequisite technologies for
this project, please see [Foundational technologies — Creative Commons Open
Source][found-tech].

### Codebases Setup

Both this repository and the [creativecommons/cc-legal-tools-data][repodata]
project repository should be cloned side by side, resulting in a structure like
the following:
```
creative-commons/
├── cc-legal-tools-app/     (git clone of this repository)
└── cc-legal-tools-data/    (git clone of the cc-legal-tools-data repository)
```

To achieve this, we recommend the following procedure:

1. Create and change to a container directory, such as `creative-commons` or `cc`.
    ```shell
    mkdir creative-commons
    cd creative-commons
    ```
2. Clone both repos using SSH or, if that does not work, HTTPS protocol.
    ```shell
    git clone git@github.com:creativecommons/cc-legal-tools-app.git
    git clone git@github.com:creativecommons/cc-legal-tools-data.git
    ```
    or
    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/creativecommons/cc-legal-tools-app.git
    git clone https://github.com/creativecommons/cc-legal-tools-data.git
    ```

Visit [Cloning a repository - GitHub Docs][gitclone] for more on how to clone a
GitHub repository.

### Docker Prep and Initial Execution

Use the following instructions to prepare and run the project with Docker
Compose.

1. Ensure all prerequisites and repositories are in place.
2. Ensure you are at the top level of the directory where you cloned this
repository (where `manage.py` is).
    ```shell
    cd cc-legal-tools-app
    ```
3. Create Django local settings file from the example file.
    ```shell
    cp cc_legal_tools/settings/local.example.py cc_legal_tools/settings/local.py
    ```
    - Update variables in new file, if necessary.
    - This file is ignored by Git.
4. Build the containers.
    ```shell
    docker compose build
    ```
5. **Run the containers.**
    ```shell
    docker compose up
    ```
   1. **app** ([127.0.0.1:8005](http://127.0.0.1:8005/)): this Django
      application
      - Any changes made to Python will be detected and rebuilt
        transparently as long as the development server is running.
   2. **static** ([127.0.0.1:8006](http://127.0.0.1:8006/)): a static web
      server serving [creativecommons/cc-legal-tools-data][repodata]:`docs/`
6. Initialize data.
Open a separate terminal tab, and in the same directory, run:
    ```shell
    ./bin/init_data.sh
    ```
    1. Deletes database (which may not yet exist)
    2. Initializes database
    3. Performs database migrations
    4. Creates supseruser (will prompt for password)
    5. Loads data

Note: Once this full setup is performed, running Step 5 above will execute the
application on any subsequent occasion.


## Project Usage

With the prerequisites installed and built, these tools can be used to generate
and manage data from the associated [data repository][repodata].


### Data

The legal tools metadata is in a database. The metadata tracks which legal
tools exist, their translations, their ports, and their characteristics like
what they permit, require, and prohibit.

~~The metadata can be downloaded by visiting the URL path:
`127.0.0.1:8005`[`/licenses/metadata.yaml`][metadata]~~ (currently disabled)

[metadata]: http://127.0.0.1:8005/licenses/metadata.yaml

There are two main models (Django terminology for tables) in
[`legal_tools/models.py`](legal_tools/models.py):
1. `LegalCode`
2. `Tool`

A Tool can be identified by a `unit` (ex. `by`, `by-nc-sa`, `devnations`) which
is a proxy for the complete set of permissions, requirements, and prohibitions;
a `version` (ex. `4.0`, `3.0)`, and an optional `jurisdiction` for ports. So we
might refer to the tool by its **identifier** "BY 3.0 AM" which would be the
3.0 version of the BY license terms as ported to the Armenia jurisdiction. For
additional information see: [**Legal Tools Namespace** -
creativecommons/cc-legal-tools-data: CC Legal Tools Data (static HTML, language
files, etc.)][namespace].

There are three places legal code text could be:
1. **Gettext files** (`.po` and `.mo`) in the
   [creativecommons/cc-legal-tools-data][repodata] repository (legal tools with
   full translation support):
   - 4.0 Licenses
   - CC0
2. **Django template**
   ([`legalcode_licenses_3.0_unported.html`][unportedtemplate]):
   - Unported 3.0 Licenses (English-only)
3. **`html` field** (in the `LegalCode` model):
   - Everything else

The text that's in gettext files can be translated via Transifex at [Creative
Commons localization][cctransifex]. For additional information on the Django
translation domains / Transifex resources, see [How the license translation is
implemented](#how-the-tool-translation-is-implemented), below.

### Translation

See [`docs/translation.md`](docs/translation.md)


### Generate Static Files

Generating static files updates the static files in the `docs/` directory of
the [creativecommons/cc-legal-tools-data][repodata] repository (the [Data
Repository](#data-repository), above).


#### Static Files Process

This process will write the HTML files in the cc-legal-tools-data clone
directory under `docs/`. By default it doesn't commit any changes.

1. Ensure the [Data Repository](#data-repository), above, is in place
2. Ensure [Docker Compose Setup](#docker-compose-setup), above, is complete
3. Run the helper script:
    ```shell
    ./bin/publish.sh
    ```
    - Example output:
        ```
        # Django publish                                                       19:36:20

       - (note that the laptop environment and docker environment had different
         timezones, CEST and UTC)


#### Publishing Changes to Git Repo

~~When the site is deployed, to enable pushing and pulling the licenses data repo
with GitHub, create an SSH deploy key for the cc-legal-tools-data repo with
write permissions, and put the private key file (not password protected)
somewhere safe (owned by `www-data` if on a server), and readable only by its
owner (0o400). Then in settings, make `TRANSLATION_REPOSITORY_DEPLOY_KEY` be
the full path to that deploy key file.~~ (not active nor current)

### Coverage Tests and Report

The coverage tests and report are run as part of pre-commit and as a GitHub
Action. To run it manually:
1. Ensure the [Data Repository](#data-repository), above, is in place
2. Ensure [Docker Compose Setup](#docker-compose-setup), above, is complete
2. Coverage test
    ```shell
    docker compose exec app coverage run manage.py test --noinput --keepdb
    ```
3. Coverage report
    ```shell
    docker compose exec app coverage report
    ```


### Commit Errors


#### Error Building Trees

If you encounter an `error: Error building trees` error from pre-commit when
you commit, try adding your files (`git add <FILES>`) before committing them.


## Frontend Dependencies

The following CC projects are used to achieve a consistent look and feel:
- [creativecommons/vocabulary-theme][vocabulary-theme]: WordPress Theme
  implementation of the Vocabulary design system

[vocabulary-theme]: https://github.com/creativecommons/vocabulary-theme

---
## Translation: Including Legal Code Templates

By default, Django’s `makemessages` command may **not detect** translatable strings inside the `templates/legalcode/` folder.

To ensure strings from those files are included:

```bash
django-admin makemessages -l en --extension=html --template-dirs=templates/legalcode
```
